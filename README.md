# Search Engine Lookup

This plugin adds a right click option on a cluster, providing the ability to lookup the cluster using a search engine in a browser window. It also provides a right click option on album and track items in the right-hand Album pane, allowing a search engine lookup for the cover art associated with the selected album or track.

When you right-click on the cluster, album or track, the lookup option is found under the "Plugins" section of the context list.
